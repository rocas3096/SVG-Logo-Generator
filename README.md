# SVG-Logo-Generator
        
## Description
I made this SVG Logo Generator to test my skills and knowledge of node.js and more specifically testing methods for my code within it. It provided practice for using jest, using standard node libraries, creating a directory structure, using constructor functions, practicing inheritance, and working with promises. The project also provided a handy tool for creating simple logos for future endeavors.
